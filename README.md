# About the project

This is a project developed for an academic task, which requires candidates to develop an app that takes in a series of inputs in the form of a simple survey, which then uses ML to produce a prediction of the survey candidate's likelihood of having diabetes. The majority of the task is mainly cleaning and transforming the data and training the ML model to produce an accurate prediction.
